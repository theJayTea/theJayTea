### Ayo :)

A platform-agnostic tech geek here! .-.

I’m ecstatic about building PCs, making hackintoshs, porting the latest builds of Android onto older devices, jailbreaking iOS, Raspberry Pi projects, VR, & gaming :}

I love Python, Java, C++ & Visual Basic. I’ve also built and hosted websites (HTML backend & CSS), dabbed into Swift, & had some game dev fun with C# and Unity!

Talk to me about psychology, philosophy, science, and poetry. I'll throw in something I wrote! :3

```
Here lies my will,
It’s been a thrill.
Life goes on, they say,
Contradicted on your death day.
You’d flash through times,
Having spent all your dimes.
Remembering love, and a nostalgic glove,
The euphoric ecstasy.
I’m here now, took a mere moment
To disappear.
