### Ayo :)

A platform-agnostic tech geek here! .-.

I’m ecstatic about building PCs, ML (LLMs in particular), making hackintoshs, porting the latest builds of Android onto older devices, jailbreaking iOS, Raspberry Pi projects, VR, & gaming :}

I'm experienced with and love Python and Java, and have a little experience with other languages like C++ & Visual Basic. I’ve also built and hosted websites (HTML backend & CSS), dabbed into Swift, & had some game dev fun with C# and Unity!

Talk to me about psychology, philosophy, science, and poetry. I'll throw in something I wrote!

```
here lies my will;
it’s been a thrill.
life goes on, they say,
contradicted on your death day.
i flashed through time,
having spent every dime.
remembering love, and a nostalgic glove -
the euphoric ecstasy.
i’m here now;
but a mere moment
to disappear.
